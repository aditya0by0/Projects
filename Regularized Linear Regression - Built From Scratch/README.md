# Regularized Logistic Regression - Built from Scratch

## DataSet Used : [CarDekho Vehicle dataset](<car data.csv>) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) 

Built Linear Regression Model from right scratch for CarDekho Vehicle dataset from Kaggle. Also have added regularization functionality to the model. This model works for single and multi-variables problems.<br />
