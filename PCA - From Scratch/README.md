# PCA - From Scratch

## DataSet Used : [Custom/Dummy data](pca_data)

Along with building model for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) step by step in the notebook, I have also animated and provided detailed explanation for each step for a beginner
to understand what PCA does actually and how it does. This will notebook also serves a quick go-through for me to recall about PCA's working. <br />
Please click [here](<PCA - Built from scratch.ipynb>) to open Jupyter Notebook for the same.<br />
You can see the code for the model [here](my_pca_from_scratch.py).
