# Regularized Logistic Regression - Built from Scratch

## DataSet Used : [Iris Data](iris.data) from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

I have built Logistic Regression model for multi-class Classification with Neural Network design approach and have added regularization to prevent overfitting.<br />
Please click [here](<Regularized Mutlinomial Logistic Regression - From Scratch.ipynb>) to open Jupyter Notebook for the same.<br />
You can see the code for the model [here](My_logistic_regression_model.py).
