# Regularized Logistic Regression - Built from Scratch

## DataSet Used : [Iris Data](iris.data)

I have built Logistic Regression model for multi-class Classification with Neural Network design approach and have added regularization to prevent overfitting.
Please click [here](Regularized Mutlinomial Logistic Regression - From Scratch.ipynb) to open Jupyter Notebook for the same.
You can see the code for the model [here](My_logistic_regression_model.py).
